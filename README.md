# Droid

Droid is my Android learning space.  
Coming from an iOS (SwiftUI) background, I’m exploring Jetpack Compose with a focus on full layout control, clear UI structure, and learning through real bugs.

This repo documents my journey — experiments, patterns, mistakes, and small insights that make Android UI predictable and manageable.
